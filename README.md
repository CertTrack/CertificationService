# Certification Service

The **Certification Service** manages the uploading, validation, and retrieval of course certifications. It is integrated with AWS S3 for secure storage of certification files and supports user-specific and admin-level operations.

## Key Features

- **Certification Upload:** Allows uploading of certification files with associated metadata.
- **Validation:** Verifies the authenticity of a certification using a unique validation code.
- **User-Centric Operations:** Retrieves certifications based on user and course IDs.
- **Admin Operations:** Provides capabilities for managing certifications, including deletion.
- **Security:** Implements role-based access control with Spring Security.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Core framework for the service.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization capabilities.
- **Auth0 (JWT)**: For Decoding JWT.
- **AWS S3**: Used for storing certification files securely.
- **Jackson ObjectMapper**: Parses and processes JSON metadata.
- **RESTful API Design**: Provides a clean and structured API interface.
- **Spring Cloud Eureka Client**
- **Swagger**: For API documentation and testing.
- **ITextPDF**: For generating pdf cetrification.

The certification records are stored in the `certifications` table with the following structure:
     Column      |          Type          | Collation | Nullable |             Default
-----------------|------------------------|-----------|----------|----------------------------------
 id              | integer                |           | not null | generated by default as identity
 course_id       | integer                |           | not null |
 file_path       | character varying(255) |           |          |
 issued_date     | character varying(255) |           |          |

## Notes

- Ensure AWS S3 permissions are correctly set up for file upload and retrieval.
- The `validationCode` must be unique for each certification.
- Metadata is case-sensitive; ensure it aligns with the expected structure.
- File paths are stored in the database but managed on AWS S3.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a feature for downloading certifications.
- Add support for updating certification details.
- Introduce expiration dates for certifications.
